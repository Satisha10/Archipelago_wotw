# Ori and the Will of the Wisps

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

The main function of this randomizer is shuffling all the item locations. That means it’s completely possible to collect a spirit light container but get the double jump skill instead. Likewise, Skill Trees don’t always give you a skill, so you might find a Gorlek Ore when activating the Bash Skill Tree.

## What items and locations get shuffled?

All main inventory items, collectables, and all locations in the game which could
contain any of those items may have their contents changed.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Any of the items which can be shuffled may also be placed into another player's world. It is possible to choose to limit
certain items to your own world.

## What does another world's item look like in OriWotW?

Items belonging to other worlds are represented by TBD.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

When the player receives an item, A Message will appear on screen telling you what item you got.

# AP World for Ori and the Will of the Wisps

Disclaimer: The AP World is completely functional, but this
is **not playable** yet, as the client is not finished yet.

The code used to generate some files, and the `.yaml` options templates can be found 
in https://github.com/Satisha10/APworld_wotw_extractors

The client code (work in progress) is in 
https://github.com/Satisha10/wotw-rando-client/tree/AP_local
